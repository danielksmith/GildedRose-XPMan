Simple Setup
------------

First off, I'm not a smalltalker, so this is only going to be a minimal descirption of how to run the Gilded Rose kata in Smalltalk.

You will need the Pharo 3.0 distribution of Smalltalk from http://www.pharo-project.org.  Download it, install it and run it.

Use the menu and goto Tools -> File Browser, navigate to the `GildedRose.st` file and click the Install button.

Open a console window with Tools -> Transcript (this is where the output of the tests will appear).

Open a Workspace window with the top level menu item 'Workspace'

In the Workspace window, type `GildedRose runExamples` and then bring up the popup menu on the Workspace and click 'Do it', the output should appear in the Transcript window.
